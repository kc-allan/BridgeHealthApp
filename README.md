# Bridge Health WebApp
Maternal care in rural areas faces challenges in tracking health progress due to antiquated manual bookkeeping practices, raising concerns about privacy and data security. To address this, we developed a user-friendly web platform tailored for expectant mothers, prioritizing privacy while offering personalized healthcare management.

Utilizing Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) for webpage design and the Structured Systems Analysis and Design Methodology (SSADM) for system development, our innovative solution revolutionizes maternal healthcare delivery.

Expectant mothers can create secure profiles on the platform, ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive medical information. Timely prompts enable symptom recording, appointment tracking, and access to essential health education materials, empowering informed decision-making. An integrated feature facilitates direct emergency communication with on-call doctors, ensuring prompt medical assistance.

Furthermore, local hospitals can transition to digital record-keeping through the platform, enhancing privacy and efficiency compared to outdated manual methods. By streamlining information management and promoting proactive health monitoring, the platform reduces maternal and infant mortality rates in rural areas.

By leveraging technology and prioritizing privacy concerns, the system facilitates seamless communication between expectant mothers and healthcare providers, ultimately improving maternal healthcare outcomes. This documentation outlines our comprehensive approach and the steps taken to achieve these goals.
